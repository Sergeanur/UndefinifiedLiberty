## How to browse between versions

This repo has versions commitied on top of each other in chronological order, so that you could easily see the changes each version provided.

You can browse commit history to reach these versions in the repo:
- **ps2_1.40** - original bugged PS2 european release
- **ps2_1.60** - correct PS2 and PC release

## How to compile

You need to get miss2.exe from 3master and then patch the 3master plague out of it.
To patch miss2.exe, put it in `patch` directory and launch **xdelta3.bat**. Now you can use miss2.exe that would produce correct compiled binaries.

## Changelog

- **2022/06/30**: removed a plague leftover comment in main.sc/main_d.sc
